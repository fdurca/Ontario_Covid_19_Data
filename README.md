# Ontario_Covid_19_Data
This project was made to analyze Covid-19 data from the Ontario government. It is used to track total cases, total recoveries, total deaths, and total new cases by region. The user will be able to easily view all this data.

I had the idea to create this project when I realized this data was not easy to find. The daily reports from the Ontario government only include total cases and new cases by region and total recoveries for the entire province. Using Javascript and Python, the user will be able to read and understand the covid-19 data easily and get a better understanding of the current pandemic.
